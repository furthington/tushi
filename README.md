# Tushi

Tushi is simplicity. No bells or whistles, no competition or pressure. A relaxing little experience that's just the right amount of mental engagement.

## Beautiful artwork
- Every piece is elegantly painted with dedication and love. It brings out the sushi chef in you.
- A modern, minimal interface ties everything together. It unclutters your mind.
- Soothing and unobtrusive animations breathe a little life into the experience. It calms your nerves.

## Relaxing gameplay
- Pick it up and put it down at any time; Tushi is caffeine-free and is not designed to be addictive.
- Start with a familiar concept and discover the little twist that is relevant to the theme of sushi-making.
- No demands of social media engagement here; only peace and quiet.
